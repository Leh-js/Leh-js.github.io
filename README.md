Leh.js is web based cli interface that relies on Wasm and Node.js and uses Esbuild to parse input and function.

The most used example for testing if it functioned in development is displayed below.

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

[NOTE] We are aware that the layout of the CLI is not professional and we don't want to be made fun of.
