Leh.js (Also called Lehdah CLI) is a web based cli interface that relies on Wasm and Node.js and uses Esbuild to parse input and function.

The most used example for testing if it functioned in development is displayed below.

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

Also a message from the creator, you cannot install packages in this, Sorry.

Trying to will result in the following error:

```plaintext
Error executing command: Error: Transform failed with 1 error:
:1:4: ERROR: Expected ";" but found "install"
```

[NOTE] We are aware that the layout of the CLI is not professional and we don't want to be made fun of.
